<li>Developed a solution which streams a connection to an exchange server and matches email criteria to a client to price bid requests for loans. I use a modified Levensthein formula to match against known clients.</li>
<li>Created an assignment tracker using Angular 6 which functions similarly to an google calendar.

Provided the ability to assign tasks to a trader by either drag and drop or click events and filter the view for each trader.</li>
