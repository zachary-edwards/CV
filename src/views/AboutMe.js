            Hi my name is Zach Edwards.

            I'm building this site to showcase my skills and improve my knowledge of React, but why need a reason to build anything?
            
            
            It might be worthwhile to take a risk and show some of my personality, this is mine afterall. 

            I have a lot of dreams for what this site could be. 
            First, what you're reading now, a little bit about me. 
            
        </div>
