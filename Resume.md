### __Experience__

__Virginia Premier__  
Full Stack Developer  
2019-01 - 2019-09
* Naturally fell into Team Lead role while taking on a variety of tasks outside of development allowing me to focus on developing my soft skills.  
* Moved PHI from a deprecated system into a replacement system and created a recurring data load by consuming REST API's.  
* Discovered and reported a major security vulnerability in a critical application which lead to us renegotiate our contract.  
* Deployed the ELK stack using docker on a Red Hat server to analyze and visualize logs.  
* Built and supported Python solutions that automate data entry for recurring processes.  

__SunTrust Mortgage, Originations & Capital Markets__  
Associate Applications Developer  
2016-06 - 2018-12  

* Developed a solution which streams a connection to an exchange server and matches email criteria to a client to price bid requests for loans. I use a modified Levensthein formula to match against known clients.
* Created an assignment tracker using Angular 6 which functions similarly to an google calendar. This tracker is used by traders to know when bids are due in addition to aiding in prioritization of their work. Provided the ability to assign tasks to a trader by either drag and drop or click events and filter the view for each trader. 
* Migrated a long running ETL which calculates P&L for our trade desk. Solutions I provided cut run time of tasks from 3 minutes to 15 seconds and also fixed deadlock concurrency issues caused by asynchronously run tasks. 
* When introduced as a full time employee I built the first Angular application for the team while learning the framework and utilized it's features to include real time calculations.

### __Additional Activities__

In my spare time I am building out a web application that integrates with Spotify's API to visualize my listening habits over time. Back end is built using .NET core 3.0 and MySQL. The front end is built on Angular 6 and the PrimeNG library.

Built an android application in college that we released to google play. The app randomly generated a grid in which the user had to find the longest Eulerian circuit and scaled in difficulty as the user progressed through the game.
