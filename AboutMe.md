### Hi, I'm **Zach Edwards**

I'm in the process of building this website to increase my skillset with react. I want a way to showcase my personality and push my self in design and implementation. Ideally, if this all works out well, I can use this as my resume and start to *freelance*.

I have some dreams for what this website is likely to become and some features that I would like to share with you in no particaluar order.

* About Me - this is what you're reading now but will be more refined and highlight who I am.
* CV/Resume - Self explaining here, this is my site and I want to use this in applications.
* References - I'm not sure about this one, seems wrong to provide peoples information about that, maybe make it available upon request.
* Work Examples - I like this idea, it could be a running blog, it could just contain what I'm working on in that particaular point in life OR projects I'm proud of.
* Contact information - Once again self explainitory, I want people to reach out to me if they want.
* Way to download/export a PDF of my so I can maintain it in this simple web app.
